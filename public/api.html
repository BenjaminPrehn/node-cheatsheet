                    <h1>How to create a REST API</h1>
                    <p>With node & express we have the option to create a REST API, which will contain - GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE.
                      Underneath i will explain each one with code examples on how it could be made. To use the examples below you need to have read trough the previous topics inside this cheatsheet.
                    </p>
                    <p>We start by making some dummy data which we can play with the API.</p>
                    <p>app.js: </p>
                    <pre>
                      <code class="language-javascript">
let animeNames = [
  {
    id: 1,
    title: "Attack of the titan",
    weirdness: 8
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    name: "One punsh man"
];
                      </code> 
                  </pre>
                  <hr>
                    <h2>GET</h2>
                    <p>With GET we would like to have two options - GET ALL and GET by ID. We start out by creating GET ALL. 
                    </p>
                    <hr>
                    <h4>GET ALL</h4>
                    <p>app.js: </p>
                    <pre>
                      <code class="language-javascript">
app.get("/anime_names",(req, res) => {
  res.send({animeNames: animeNames});
});
                      </code> 
                  </pre>
                  <p>The above code is how we would make a GET request which is getting all data inside our array.
                    We do so by sending a response (res) back with "animeNames" which is our list of diffrent Animes. 
                  </p>
                  <hr>
                  <h4>GET by ID</h4>
                  <p>But what if we only want to know a single anime name. Then we can get it by its ID.</p>
                  <pre>
                    <code class="language-javascript">
app.get("/anime_names/:id", (req,res) => {
  const animeNameId = Number(req.params.id);
  const foundAnimeName = animeNames.find(animeName => animeName.id === animeNameId)
  res.send({data: foundAnimeName})
});
                    </code> 
                </pre>
                <p>What we do is like before we are going by the url endpoint "/anime_names/" but this time we add a request to it aswell ":id". This mean that the user can type in something like "anime_names/?id=1" and then get the Anime back with the ID of 1.
                The code itself is saving the request inside a const named "animeNameId". Then we use that variable to go trough oir list of animeNames and then us the funtion ".find()" to find the specific id that we stored inside animeNameId to make sure we are returning the correct id.
                In the end we are returning our variable "foundAnimeName" to the user with the res.send(). 
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h4>POST</h4>
                <p>
                  POST means create, so we are working with the "anime_names" endpoint, we don't want to include the id since we shouldn't expect that the user know what id is already in our list and which one should be the next. 
                  We therefore want it to autoincrement the ID to make sure that no Animes ever get the same id. We therefore start be creating a variable to contain our id.
                </p>
                <p>app.js</p>
                <pre>
                  <code class="language-javascript">
let AUTOINCREMENT = 2;
                    
app.post("/anime_names", (req, res) => {
  const newAnimeName = req.body;
  newAnimeName.id = ++AUTOINCREMENT;
  animeNames.push(newAnimeName);
  res.send({data: newAnimeName});
});
                  </code> 
              </pre>
              <p>So we take the "req.body" which is what the user typed and save in the variable "newAnimeName". 
                Then we set the id to be the autoincremented value and add +1 on to to make sure that it's a unique ID.
                Then we push our new data which is stored inside "newAnimeName" into our list of data and then we display to the user the data which have been saved into our list.
              </p>
              <hr>
              <h4>PATCH</h4>
              <p>With PATCH we have the option to update part or all of the information inside a specific ID. 
                Since we want to update a specfic item with use the ID as a selector to choose what should be updated. 
              </p>
              <pre>
                <code class="language-javascript">
app.use(express.json());

app.patch("/anime_names/:id", (req, res) => {

  animeNames = animeNames.map(animeName => {
                
  if (animeName.id === Number(req.params.id)) {
    return {...animeName, ...req.body, id: animeName.id};
  }
    return animeName; 
                
  });
                
  res.send({ data: wasUpdated });
});
                </code> 
            </pre>
            <p>First of all, since we are going to send back JSON, we need our server to be able to handle that.
              We Do that by writting the first line to tell that app should use express.json. By doing so we use the .map() function to find a select the correct ID of our list. 
              And if we have a match we are returning a new JSON with the updated information, which the user have inserted in the request body. 
              In the end we send back the updated information, so the user can see what they just updated.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h4>DELETE</h4>
            <p>With delete we NEVER want to wipe the whole database of all its data. So again we use id to select an item from our list.

            </p>
            <pre>
              <code class="language-javascript">
app.delete("/anime_names/:id", (req, res) => {
    
  animeNames = animeNames.filter(animeName => animeName.id !== Number(req.params.id));
            
  res.send({ data: animeNames});
});
                              </code> 
                          </pre>
                          <p>We then filter all id that is not equal to the one we want to delete. And then save them back into our list. 
                            This way we are able to delete an item by id. 
                            In the end we then return the list whcih should have deleted the item we wanted to delete. 
                          </p>
